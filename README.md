# SUDOKU-SOLVER
This project is a Sudoku Solver implemented using C++. It is a console-based application that takes a 9Ã—9 Sudoku puzzle as input, solves it using backtracking, and displays the completed solution. The program ensures that each row, column, and 3Ã—3 sub-grid follows the rules of Sudoku.

How the Program Works:

Step 1: User Inputs the Sudoku Grid
	â€¢	The user enters the board row by row.
	â€¢	The program verifies and stores the input.

Step 2: Solving the Sudoku
	â€¢	The recursive backtracking function tries placing numbers.
	â€¢	If a valid number is found, the process continues.
	â€¢	If an incorrect number is placed, the function backtracks and tries a different number.

Step 3: Displaying the Solution
	â€¢	If the Sudoku is solvable, the program prints the completed board.
	â€¢	If no solution exists, the program informs the user.

 Technologies Used

âœ… C++ â€“ Core programming language for implementing logic.

âœ… Standard I/O (cin, cout) â€“ Used for taking input and displaying output.

âœ… 2D Vector (vector<vector<char>>) â€“ Data structure to store the board.

âœ… Backtracking Algorithm â€“ Solving strategy to fill the board efficiently.

âœ… Looping & Conditional Statements â€“ Used for decision-making and iteration.

Future Improvements & Enhancements

ðŸ”¹ Graphical User Interface (GUI) â€“ Implement a UI using SFML or Qt for better visualization.

ðŸ”¹ Sudoku Puzzle Generator â€“ Create randomized Sudoku puzzles for users to solve.

ðŸ”¹ Difficulty Levels â€“ Implement easy, medium, and hard puzzles.

ðŸ”¹ AI-Based Solver â€“ Use constraint programming or machine learning to optimize solving speed.

ðŸ”¹ File Handling â€“ Save and load Sudoku puzzles from external files.

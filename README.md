# SUDOKU-SOLVER
This project is a Sudoku Solver implemented using C++. It is a console-based application that takes a 9×9 Sudoku puzzle as input, solves it using backtracking, and displays the completed solution. The program ensures that each row, column, and 3×3 sub-grid follows the rules of Sudoku.
